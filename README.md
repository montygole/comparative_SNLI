Comparative study of four models on the SNLI dataset
# Note: 
This is the final research project which I chose for CP8210 @ TMU in Spring 2023


# Getting Started:
Please obtain a copy of the `glove.6B.100d.txt` file from the [Stanford NLP site](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

# Run
`all_four_models.py` to build/execute models

`SNLI Dataset Analysis and Model Comparison.ipynb` to see both an analysis of the SNLI dataset, and build/execute models
