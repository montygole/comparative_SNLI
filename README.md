# comparative_SNLI
Comparative study of four models on the SNLI dataset
### Note: 
This is the final research project which I chose for CP8210 @ TMU in Spring 2023


## Getting Started:
Please obtain a copy of the `glove.6B.100d.txt` file from the [Stanford NLP site](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

## Execution
`all_four_models.py` to build/execute models

`SNLI Dataset Analysis and Model Comparison.ipynb` to see both an analysis of the SNLI dataset, and build/execute models

## In-Depth Documentation
For an in-depth understanding of the project, refer to `Comparative SNLI.pdf`. This document encapsulates a detailed write-up, offering an exploration of the project's objectives, methodologies, findings, and conclusions.
